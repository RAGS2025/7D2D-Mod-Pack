LittleRedSonja & Mumpfy Armor Pack 01 - DangerGirls ---- by LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy

Installation Instructions:

Extract the downloaded zip into your 7D2D Mods folder (create one if it does not exist).

To verify you have installed the mod correctly, the ModInfo.xml file should be located at Mods\LittleRedSonja_Mumpfy_LittleRedSonja_Mumpfy_ArmorPack01_DangerGirls\ModInfo.xml relative to your 7D2D install folder.

This mod IS NOT Server-Side-Only. Since it adds custom assets it requires installation both in server AND client for multiplayer. For solo player install like any other mod.

This mod can be used with both EAC ON or EAC OFF, it does not matter.

You can combine different parts from different armors, but this sometimes can result  in clipping or visual glitches, in the same way this also happens with the vanilla armors.



We hope you enjoy the mod ðŸ’œ. Let us know too if you have suggestions or find bugs.Â Â ðŸ¥°
