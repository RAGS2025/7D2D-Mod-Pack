LittleRedSonja & Mumpfy Armor Pack 01 - DangerGirls ---- by LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy

Changelog:

1.0.0 - Adds 5 completely new and superior female armors to the game, in different styles: 3 light, 1 medium, 1 heavy. 

1.0.1 - Fixes the damage bonus with suppressed weapons for the "Snake between Flowers" armor being lower than intended. 


This is the first armor pack in a much bigger project that Mumpfy and me are making together. You can expect more different armor packs, in different styles. 

All our armor packs present and future can be used together without any worries, and they all can be used together with all my other mods. 


1.0.1 - Fixed some calculations that caused some of the showed some stats not reflecting the actual in game values.
